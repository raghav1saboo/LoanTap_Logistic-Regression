[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/raghav1saboo/LoanTap_Logistic-Regression/blob/main/LoanTap_Logistic_Regression.ipynb)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals applying for a Personal Loan through LoanTap. The goal is to determine whether a credit line should be extended to an applicant based on a set of provided attributes.

LoanTap is an online platform offering customized loan products to millennials. This project specifically addresses the underwriting process for their Personal Loan product.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of attributes for an individual, the task is to determine if a credit line should be extended to them. Furthermore, the analysis explores potential repayment terms as business recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `[LoanTapData.csv]'.

## Concepts Used

The Jupyter Notebook implements the following concepts:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the data and identify patterns.
* **Feature Engineering:** To create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
* **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model used for binary classification to predict the likelihood of loan approval.
* **Precision Vs Recall Tradeoff:** Understanding and potentially adjusting the classification threshold to balance precision and recall based on business needs.
